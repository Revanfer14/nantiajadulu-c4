# CLAUDE.md

Master context file for **Jaga** (Xcode project/bundle name: `drivecompanion`) — an iOS driving-companion app that keeps drivers alert on the road. This file is the entry point for understanding the whole codebase; hand it to Claude Code (or any implementer) alongside the feature-specific specs listed under [Related Documentation](#related-documentation).

Bundle ID: `com.nantiajadulu.drivecompanion` · iOS deployment target: 26.0+ · Xcode 26.6 · Swift 5, SwiftUI.

## What This App Is

Jaga is built as a **university/course group project**. It has two independent core features living side by side in the same app, connected only by a bottom tab switcher in `drivecompanionApp.swift`:

1. **AI Companion** ("teman menyetir") — a fully voice-driven conversational presence that chats with the driver, checks in proactively, and keeps them company. Screen: `AIGeminiView.swift`.
2. **Detection** — camera-based drowsiness/microsleep detection using ARKit face tracking, triggering an audible alarm when precursor signals cross thresholds. Screen: `DetectionView.swift`.

## Product Philosophy

This governs every design decision in the app and should not be re-litigated without explicit reason:

- **Non-judgmental companion, not a monitoring/gating system.** Jaga is a driving buddy, not a supervisor. There is no "fit-to-drive" gate that blocks or scores the driver — that idea was explicitly considered and ruled out.
- **Predicts rather than reacts.** A 1–2 second microsleep at driving speed can't be "won" reactively once it starts. Detection is built around precursor signals (PERCLOS trend, blink duration, head drift) rather than waiting for the microsleep event itself — see `DrowsinessDetector.swift`.
- **Six DURING-phase innovation principles** (design targets, not all fully implemented yet — see [Known Gaps](#known-gaps--open-items)):
  1. Closed-loop arousal with self-measured recovery
  2. Sleep-inertia-aware activation
  3. Anti-habituation by design
  4. Intervention intensity scaled to kinetic danger, not just drowsiness score
  5. Breaking the drowsiness oscillation wave-train early
  6. Graceful handoff from "keep awake" to "stop safely" when interventions fail
- **Safety-critical alerts are never routed through an LLM.** Drowsiness/microsleep alarms are fully deterministic (`AlarmService.swift`, triggered directly by `DrowsinessDetector` state). This keeps the safety path independent of connectivity, model quality, or LLM failure modes — non-negotiable.
- **Localization:** all user-facing strings are **Bahasa Indonesia** (`id-ID` locale, both STT and TTS). Code identifiers, docs, and comments-that-would-otherwise-exist stay in English.

## Feature 1 — AI Companion

Full spec lives in `GeminiModel.md` — read that for system persona, session modes, permission flow, and setup steps. Summary of the architecture actually in the codebase:

```
Driver speech (mic, id-ID) ──▶ SpeechInput (SFSpeechRecognizer, silence-timeout utterance detection)
      │
      ▼
   Online?  ──yes──▶ GeminiRouter ──▶ GeminiService (REST, streamGenerateContent)
      │no                  │ (all models exhausted / transient failure)
      ▼                    ▼
FoundationModels (on-device, LanguageModelSession) ──▶ static fallback line
      │
      ▼
SpeechOutput (AVSpeechSynthesizer, id-ID voice, sentence-by-sentence streaming)
```

Key files: `AIViewmodel.swift` (orchestration, session modes, proactive timer, `NWPathMonitor` for online/offline), `GeminiRouter.swift` (fallback chain, caching, quota tracking), `GeminiService.swift` (raw REST client), `SpeechInput.swift` / `SpeechOutput.swift`, `AIGeminiView.swift` (mode picker + Start/Stop, no chat UI).

### Gemini fallback chain

`GeminiRouterConfig.fallbackChain` in `GeminiRouter.swift` is the source of truth. Router tries each model in order, skips models that are daily-quota-exhausted or in cooldown, retries transient errors (429 / 5xx) with backoff, and falls through to the next model on persistent failure:

| Order | Model | RPM cap | RPD cap | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `gemini-3.5-flash` | 5 | 20 | Primary — highest quality, tightest quota |
| 2 | `gemini-3-flash` | 5 | 20 | |
| 3 | `gemini-2.5-flash` | 5 | 20 | |
| 4 | `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | 10 | 20 | |
| 5 | `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` | 15 | 500 | Most quota-generous "real" Gemini model |
| 6 | `gemma-4-26b` | 15 | 1500 | |
| 7 | `gemma-4-31b` | 15 | 1500 | Last resort before Foundation Models fallback |

Other quota-defense mechanisms in `GeminiRouterConfig`: response cache (1hr TTL, SHA256 of system instruction + history), per-model RPM sliding-window queue, RPD tracking that resets at midnight Pacific, 2 retries per model with 1.0s/2.0s backoff, then a 60s cooldown before that model is tried again. Mock mode was intentionally removed — always hits real quota.

## Feature 2 — Detection

Uses ARKit's TrueDepth face tracking to watch for drowsiness precursors and fires a deterministic audible alarm. No LLM involvement anywhere in this path.

```
ARFaceTrackingConfiguration (TrueDepth camera)
      │  blendShapes: eyeBlinkLeft/Right, jawOpen, face transform → pitch
      ▼
FaceTrackingService ──▶ CameraViewModel ──▶ DrowsinessDetector.update()
                                                   │
                                                   ▼
                                          DrowsinessState (alert / drowsy / microsleep / noFace)
                                                   │
                                                   ▼
                                             AlarmService (looping .wav, .duckOthers overrides silent mode)
```

`DrowsinessDetector.swift` tracks four independent signals and combines them into a state machine each frame:

| Signal | Mechanism | Threshold | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| PERCLOS | Rolling 30s window of eye-openness samples; % of samples below 0.75 counts as "closed" | > 0.15 fraction closed, and driver not currently in a 3s+ "alert" streak | → `drowsy` |
| CLOSDUR (microsleep) | Continuous duration eye-openness stays below 0.4 | ≥ 2.0s | → `microsleep` (highest priority state) |
| Head drop | Continuous duration face pitch exceeds 0.2 rad | ≥ 1.0s, combined with PERCLOS > half the fading threshold | → `drowsy` |
| Yawn | Continuous duration jaw-open blend shape ≥ 0.8 | ≥ 3.0s | → `drowsy` regardless of PERCLOS |

Recovery: once the driver's eyes stay open ≥3.0s (`alert` streak) while previously `drowsy`, the PERCLOS history is reseeded so the alarm doesn't linger on stale samples. Losing face tracking entirely resets the detector and stops any alarm (`noFace` state).

Key files: `FaceTrackingService.swift` (ARSession + blend-shape extraction), `DrowsinessDetector.swift` (state machine), `AlarmService.swift` (`AVAudioPlayer` looping `drowsy_alert`/`microsleep_alert`), `CameraViewModel.swift` (orchestration, publishes `@Published` state to the view), `CameraPreview.swift` (`ARSCNView` wrapper rendering the face-mesh wireframe), `DetectionView.swift` (camera preview + debug numeric overlay + state banner).

## Tech Stack

- **Swift 5 / SwiftUI**, iOS 26.0+ deployment target. Companion-layer files are gated `@available(iOS 26.0, *)` because of the `FoundationModels` dependency.
- **ARKit + SceneKit** — `ARFaceTrackingConfiguration`, requires TrueDepth camera hardware.
- **Speech** — `SFSpeechRecognizer`, locale `id-ID`.
- **AVFoundation** — `AVSpeechSynthesizer` (TTS), `AVAudioPlayer` (alarms), `AVAudioSession` (`.playAndRecord` for companion, `.playback` + `.duckOthers` for alarms).
- **FoundationModels** — on-device LLM, offline fallback only (`LanguageModelSession`).
- **Network** — `NWPathMonitor` for online/offline routing.
- **CryptoKit** — SHA256 cache keys in `GeminiRouter`.
- Gemini access is **direct `URLSession` REST calls**, not the Firebase SDK — deferred until iOS 27 is stable (~September 2026), see `GeminiModel.md`.

## Code Style Requirements

**This applies repo-wide, to every file in the project, not just the AI/LLM layer:**

- Clean, structured Swift following standard Swift API design conventions.
- **No comments of any kind** — no inline `//` explanations, no doc comments (`///`), no `// MARK: -` section dividers, nothing.
- The **only** exception is the header block Xcode auto-generates when creating a new file (the `//  FileName.swift` / `//  drivecompanion` / `//  Created by ... on ...` block). Leave that exactly as generated — don't add to it, don't strip it.

## Configuration & Secrets

- `GEMINI_API_KEY` lives in `Secrets.xcconfig` at the project root (gitignored) and is surfaced into `Info.plist` via `$(GEMINI_API_KEY)`, read at runtime through `Bundle.main.object(forInfoDictionaryKey:)`.
- **Known incident:** `Secrets.xcconfig` was committed before `.gitignore` covered it. Because `.gitignore` isn't retroactive, the fix was `git rm --cached Secrets.xcconfig` + commit, and the exposed key was treated as compromised and regenerated in Google AI Studio rather than scrubbing history. Any key that touches a commit — pushed or not — gets treated as burned. Always verify `Secrets.xcconfig` is gitignored *before* it's created/staged.
- Free-tier only, everywhere: Google AI Studio API key with billing disabled, no paid dashboards. Quota is monitored manually at `aistudio.google.com/usage`.

## Known Gaps / Open Items

Things noticed while reading the current code that are worth flagging, not necessarily blockers:

- **`ContentView.swift`** is the unmodified Xcode "Hello, world!" template and isn't referenced by `drivecompanionApp.swift` — looks safe to delete.
- **Companion and Detection are fully siloed.** `AIViewModel` has no awareness of `DrowsinessState`, so the companion can't yet lean into its stated role of scaling intervention to drowsiness/kinetic danger (innovation principle #4) — right now that logic only lives in `AlarmService`'s binary alarm, with no shared state between the two features.
- **Head-motion signal source:** the current head-pitch signal comes from the ARKit face anchor transform (TrueDepth camera, `FaceTrackingService.swift`), not `CMHeadphoneMotionManager`/AirPods. If AirPods-based head motion is still the intended primary signal, that integration hasn't landed in this codebase yet — Apple Watch as a secondary confirmation layer is likewise not present.
- **`DetectionView.swift`** is a debug view (raw numeric overlay of openness/jaw/pitch/PERCLOS/closed-duration) rather than a production UI.
- No persistence of detection events or session history yet for either feature.
- Alarm `.wav` assets (`drowsy_alert`, `microsleep_alert`) must exist in the app bundle for `AlarmService` to do anything — worth double-checking they're actually added as bundle resources, not just referenced by name.
- Nav title in `AIGeminiView` currently reads `"C4"` — likely a placeholder/course-code artifact, flag before any demo/submission.
